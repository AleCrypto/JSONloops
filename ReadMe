#JSONloops 
## a javascript audio sequencer for node.js and the browser that can sequence songs in JSONloop the format

            JSONloops are nested arrays that contain: a nested array, a sound, or null
    
            the arrays are nested in the following hierarchy 
    
            * SONG
            *   TRACKS
            *     MEASURES
            *       BEATS

            a 3 track song with 2 measures per track, with 4 beats in each measure might be structured as something like this
            
            // measures in song
            var measures = 1;
            // beats per measure
            var beats = 4;
            // beats per minute
            var bpm = 180;

            // simple drum kit
            var drums = {
              kick : './wavs/kick.wav',
              snare : './wavs/snare.wav',
              tick : './wavs/tick.wav'
            };

            // simple 4 beat drum loop, notice the empty arrays which represent beats with no note playing
            var song = [
              [  /* TRACK 1 - kicks  */  
                [  /* measure 1 */ 
                  [drums.kick],
